My work introduces the foundations of **fitness landscape design (FLD)**, my new approach to shape the evolutionary landscape of proteins to fight disease. Using FLD, I **design "evolutionary traps"**—for example, using antibodies—to combat the rapid evolution of proteins in infectious pathogens and in cancer. Broadly, I am interested in understanding links between thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions and protein evolution. 

I am a fourth-year Harvard-MIT MD-PhD student in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology MD and Harvard Chemistry PhD programs, where I am funded by a [Hertz Fellowship](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/people/vaibhav-mohanty/), a [PD Soros Fellowship](https://pdsoros.org/fellows/vaibhav-mohanty/) and by an NIH Medical Scientist Training Program grant. I am also a [Resident Tutor and Co-Chair of Fellowships and Pre-Med Teams at Quincy House at Harvard College](https://quincy.harvard.edu/people/vaibhav-mohanty-0).

I utilize techniques from **statistical physics of evolution**, **genotype-phenotype maps**, and **spin glasses and complex systems** in my research. Past research has been in time-dependent quantum mechanics of graphene electrons, mathematics and music theory, and diffusion MRI.

I received a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Oxford as a [Marshall Scholar](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/scholars/scholar-profiles/vaibhav-mohanty/), where I worked in the Condensed Matter Theory group in Prof. Ard Louis' group. In 2019, I received my master's in Chemistry (Theory) and my bachelor's in Chemistry and Physics with a minor in Music from Harvard University, where I was a Goldwater Scholar.

Outside of research, I am a [classical and jazz composer, pianist, and saxophonist](https://www.mohantymusic.com/).
